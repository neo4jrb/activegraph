== 4.0.0.rc.1
This release introduces API changes that may be considered breaking under certain conditions. See See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j.rb-v4-Introduction.
Please use https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues for support regarding this update! You can also reach us on Twitter: @neo4jrb (Brian) and @subvertallmedia (Chris).
* Default behavior changed: relationship types default to all caps, no prepending of "#". This behavior can be changed.
* ActiveRel models no longer require explicit calling of `type`. When missing, the model will infer a type using the class name following the same rules used to determine automatic relationship types from ActiveNode models.
* _classname properties will not be added automatically if you are using a version Neo4j >= 2.1.5. Instead, models are found using labels or relationship type. This is a potentially breaking change, particularly where ActiveRel is concerned. See the link at the beginning of this message for the steps required to work around this.
* Query scopes are now chainable! Call `all` at the start of your scope or method to take advantage of this.
* Changes required for Neo4j 2.2.
* Support for custom typecasters.
* New method `rel_where`, expanded behavior of `match_to` and `first_rel_to`
* Implemented ActiveSupport load hooks.
* Assorted performance improvements and refactoring.

== 3.0.4
* Gemspec requires the latest neo4j-core.
* Fixed a pagination bug — thanks, @chrisgogreen!
* New QueryProxy methods `match_to` and `first_rel_to` are pretty cool.
* include_root_in_json is now configurable through config.neo4j.include_root_in_json or Neo4j::Config[:include_root_in_json]. Also cool.
* There's a new `delete_all` method for QueryProxy, too.
* @codebeige removed the `include?` class method, which was smart.
* Did I mention we won an award from Neo Tech? Check it out. https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j#welcome-to-neo4jrb

== 3.0.3
* Gemspec has been updated to require neo4j-core 3.0.5
* Added `find_in_batches`
* Pagination has been updated to allow better ordering. Relaunch of neo4j-will_paginate as neo4j-will_paginate_redux is imminent!
* Everything is better: `create`'s handling of blocks, better behavior from `count`, better ActiveRel from_class/to_class checks, better handling of rel_class strings, and more
* Added a new find_or_create_by class method

Big thanks to new contributors Miha Rekar and Michael Perez! Also check out or Github issues, where we're discussing changes for 3.1.0. https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues

== 3.0.2
* "Model#all" now evaluates lazily, models no longer include Enumerable
* Faster, more efficient uniqueness validations
* Adjusted many common queries to use params, will improve performance

* Allow inheritance when checking model class on a relation (Andrew Jones)
* Provided migrations will use Rake.original_dir instead of Rails.env to provide better compatibility with frameworks other than Rails
* rel_class option in ActiveNode models will now accept string of a model name
* Additional bug fixes
