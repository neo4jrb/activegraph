## [8.0.0.alpha.3]

### Skipped

## [8.0.0.alpha.2] 2016-08-05

### Changed

- Improve migration output format / show execution time in migrations

### Fixed

- Caching of model index and constraint checks
- Error when running schema migrations.  Migrations now give a warning and instructions if a migration fails and cannot be recovered
- Error when running rake tasks to generate "force" creations of indexes / constraints and there is no migration directory
- `WARNING` is no longer displayed for constraints defined from `id_property` (either one which is implict or explict)

## [8.0.0.alpha.1] 2016-08-02

### Changed

- Improved `QueryProxy` and `AssociationProxy` `#inspect` method to show a result preview (thanks ProGM / see #1228 #1232)
- Renamed the old migration task to `neo4j:legacy_migrate`
- Renamed the ENV variable to silence migrations output from `silenced` to `MIGRATIONS_SILENCED`
- Changed the behavior with transactions when a validation fails. This is a potentially breaking change, since now calling `save` would not fail the current transaction, as expected. (thanks ProGM / see #1156)
- Invalid options to the `property` method now raise an exception (see #1169)
- Label #indexes/#constraints return array without needing to access [:property_keys]
- `server_db` server type is no longer supported.  Use `http` instead to connect to Neo4j via the HTTP JSON API

- Adding explicit identity method for use in Query strings (thanks brucek / see #1159)
- New adaptor-based API has been created for connecting to Neo4j (See the [upgrade guide](TODO!!!!)).  Changes include:
- The old APIs are deprecated and will be removed later.
- In the new API, there is no such thing as a "current" session.  Users of `neo4j-core` must create and maintain references themselves to their sessions
- New `Neo4j::Core::Node` and `Neo4j::Core::Relationshp` classes have been created to provide consistent results between adaptors.  `Neo4j::Core::Path` has also been added
- New API is centered around Cypher.  No special methods are defined to, for example, load/create/etc... nodes/relationships
- There is now a new API for making multiple queries in the same HTTP request
- It is now possible to subscribe separately to events for querying in different adaptors and for HTTP requests (see [the docs](TODO!!!!))
- Schema queries (changes to indexes/constraints) happen in a separate thread for performance and reduce the complexity of the code
- New session API does not include replacement for on_next_session_available
- Adding a migration helper to mass relabel migrations (thanks @JustinAiken / see #1166 #1239)
- Added support for `find_or_initialize_by` and `first_or_initialize` methods from ActiveRecord (thanks ProGM / see #1164)
- Support for using Neo4j-provided IDs (`neo_id`) instead of UUID or another Ruby-provided ID. (Huge thanks to @klobuczek, see #1174)

## [7.0.0] - 03-18-2016

No changes from `rc.7`

## [7.0.0.rc.7] - 03-16-2016

### Changed

- `with_associations` now generates separate `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses, separated by `WITH` clauses and is preceeded by a `WITH` clause.

## [7.0.0.rc.6] - 03-16-2016

### Fixed

- Question mark methods (`node.foo?`) broke when ActiveAttr was removed

## [7.0.0.rc.5] - 03-14-2016

## [7.0.0.rc.2] - 03-08-2016

### Fixed

- Issue where creating relationships via `has_one` association created two relationships (forward ported from 6.0.7 / 6.1.9)

## [7.0.0.rc.1] - 03-08-2016

### Changed

- All explicit dependencies on `ActiveAttr` code that was not removed outright can now be found in the `Neo4j::Shared` namespace.
- All type conversion uses Neo4j.rb-owned converters in the `Neo4j::Shared::TypeConverters` namespace. This is of particular importance where `Boolean` is concerned. Where explicitly using `ActiveAttr::Typecasting::Boolean`, use `Neo4j::Shared::Boolean`.
- `Neo4j::Shared::TypeConverters.converters` was replaced with `Neo4j::Shared::TypeConverters::CONVERTERS`.
- Error classes refactor: All errors now inherits from `Neo4j::Error`. All specific `InvalidParameterError` were replaced with a more generic `Neo4j::InvalidParameterError`.
- When calling `Node.find(...)` with missing ids, `Neo4j::RecordNotFound` now returns a better error message and some informations about the query.

#### Internal

- Ran transpec and fixed error warning (thanks brucek / #1132)

### Added

- A number of modules and unit tests were moved directly from the ActiveAttr gem, which is no longer being maintained.
- `ActiveNode` models now respond to `update_all` (thanks ProGM / #1113)
- Association chains now respond to `update_all` and `update_all_rels` (thanks ProGM / #1113)
- Rails will now rescue all `Neo4j::RecordNotFound` errors with a 404 status code by default
- A clone of [ActiveRecord::Enum](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html) API. See docs for details. (thanks ProGM / #1129)
- Added #branch method to `QueryProxy` to allow for easy branching of matches in association chains (thanks ProGM / #1147 / #1143)
- The `.match` method on ActiveNode model class has changed to allow a second argument which takes `on_create`, `on_match`, and `set` keys.  These allow you to define attribute values for the Cypher `MERGE` in the different cases (thanks leviwilson / see #1123)

### Removed

- All external [ActiveAttr](https://github.com/cgriego/active_attr) dependencies.
- All `call` class methods from Type Converters. Use `to_ruby` instead.
- `Neo4j::ActiveNode::Labels::InvalidQueryError`, since it's unused.

### Fixed

- Issue where creating relationships via `has_one` association created two relationships (forward ported from 6.0.7)

## [6.1.8] - 2016-03-02

### Fixed

- The `@attributes` hash of the first node of each class returned from the database would have have the wrong id property key. This did not appear to cause any problems accessing the value and would be normal for subsequent saves of the affected node as well as all other nodes.

## [6.1.7] - 2016-02-16

### Fixed

- Bug related to creating subclassed nodes alongside rels in ActiveRel. (#1135. Thanks, brucek!)

## [6.1.6] - 2016-02-03

### Added

- `wait_for_connection` configuration variable allows you to tell the gem to wait for up to 60 seconds for Neo4j to be available.  This is useful in environments such as Docker Compose

## [6.1.5] - 2016-01-28

### Fixed

- Calls to `.find`/`.find_by_id`/`.find_by_ids` now respect scopes and associations

## [6.1.4] - 2016-01-26

## [6.1.1] - 2016-01-01

### Fixed

- Fixed version requirement for `neo4j-core` in gemspec

## [6.1.0] - 2016-01-01

### Changed

- When a `model_class` is specified on an association which is not an ActiveNode model, an error is raised
- The `model_class` option on associations can no longer be a `Class` constant (should be a String, Symbol, nil, false, or an Array of Symbols/Strings)
- The `rel_class` option on associations can no longer be a `Class` constant (should be a String, Symbol, or nil)
- The `from_class` and `to_class` arguments can no longer be a `Class` constant (should be a String, Symbol, :any, or false)
- ActiveNode and ActiveRel models can now be marshaled (thanks to jhoffner for the suggestion in #1093)

### Fixed

- Inheritance of properties in ActiveRel is fixed (see #1080)

### Added

- `config/neo4j.yml` now renders with an ERB step (thanks to mrstif via #1060)

### Fixed

- Fix to `find_in_batches` (thanks to ProGM / see #1208)

## [6.0.8] - 03-14-2016

- Fixed issue where backticks weren't being added to where clauses for `with_associations`

## [6.0.7] - 03-08-2016

### Fixed

- Issue where `inspect` failed outside of Rails (Thanks to louspringer, #1111)

## [6.0.5] - 12-29-2015

### Fixed

- If a property and a scope have the same name, a "Stack level too deep" error occurs.  Fixed by removing the instance method which scopes define.  Could break something, but I very much doubt anybody is using this, and if they are it's likely a bug (#1088)

## [6.0.4] - 12-23-2015

### Fixed

- When a `model_class` is specified on an association which is not an ActiveNode model, an error is raised

## [6.0.3] - 12-18-2015

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where find_or_create was prioritizing property`s default value rather than what was being passed in (Thanks to brucek via #1071)

## [6.0.2] - 12-16-2015

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where association setting can't be set on initialize via #new (#1065)

## [6.0.1] - 11-27-2015

### Fixed

- `#with_associations` should use multiple `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses instead of one so that matches are independent (behavior changed in Neo4j 2.3.0) (forward ported from 5.2.15)

## [6.0.0] - 11-24-2015

### Fixed

- Refactor unpersisted association logic to store objects directly on the object rather than the association proxy since different association proxies may be created at different times (see #1043)

## [6.0.0.rc.4] - 11-19-2015

### Fixed

- Following a '#with' with a '#count' no longer causes issues with variables specified twice

## [6.0.0.rc.3] - 11-18-2015

### Fixed

- Removed extra `MATCH` which occurs from `proxy_as` calls

## [6.0.0.rc.2] - 11-17-2015

### Changed

- `QueryProxy#<<` and `#create`, when `rel_class` option is set, will use `RelClass.create!` instead of `create` to alert the user of failed rel creations.

## [6.0.0.rc.1] - 11-13-2015

This release contains no changes since the last alpha. Below are all modifications introduced in alpha releases.

### Changed

- `_classname` property has been completely removed, officially dropping support for Neo4j < 2.1.5.
- `ActiveRel#creates_unique` and the `:unique` Association option take arguments to control how the query is built. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/1038.
- `#<<` and `#create` methods on associations now create with the `rel_class` when available so that validations/callbacks/defaults are all used as expected
- Allow calling of `#method=` methods via model `new` method `Hash` argument
- Remove uniqueness validation for `id_property` because we already have Neo4j constraints
- Improved eager loading when no with_associations is specified (see #905)
- Change size and length so that they match expected Ruby / ActiveRecord behavior (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6083219/activerecord-size-vs-count and #875)
- Refactoring around indexing and constraints in `Neo4j::ActiveNode`. The public interfaces are unchanged.
- `Neo4j::Shared::DeclaredPropertyManager` was renamed `Neo4j::Shared::DeclaredProperties`. All methods referencing the old name were updated to reflect this.
- Methods that were using `Neo4j::Session#on_session_available` were updated to reflect the upstream change to `on_next_session_available`.
- `rel_where` will now use ActiveRel classes for type conversion, when possible.
- Converters will look for a `converted?` method to determine whether an object is of the appropriate type for the database. This allows converters to be responsible for multiple types, if required.
- Removed the ability to set both an exact index and unique constraint on the same property in a model. Unique constraints also provide exact indexes.
- Deprecated all methods in ActiveRel's Query module except for those that allow finding by id.
- Return `true` on successful `#save!` calls (Thanks to jmdeldin)

### Added

- Optional three-argument signature for `ActiveRel#create` and `#create!`, just like `initialize`.
- Alternate `ActiveRel` init syntax: `RelClass.new(from_node, to_node, args)`. This is optional, so giving a single hash with props with or without nodes is still possible.
- `ActiveRel` `create` actions can now handle unpersisted nodes.
- `rel_order` method for association chaining
- Support `config/neo4j.yaml`
- Look for ENV variables for Neo4j URL / path for Rails apps
- New classes for schema operations, predictably called `Neo4j::Schema::Operation` and subclasses `UniqueConstraintOperation` and `ExactIndexOperation`. These provide methods to aid in the additional, removal, and presence checking of indexes and constraints.
- A few methods were added to `Neo4j::Shared::DeclaredProperties` to make it easier to work with. In particular, `[key]` acts as a shortcut for `DeclaredProperties#registered_properties`.
- Type Converters were added for String, Integer, Fixnum, BigDecimal, and Boolean to provide type conversion for these objects in QueryProxy.
- Support for Array arguments to ActiveRel's `from_class` and `to_class`.

### Fixed

- Regression RE: properties being overwritten with their defaults on save in alpha.10.
- Long properties in `ActiveNode`/`ActiveRel` `#inspect` are truncated
- Property defaults are set initially when an instance of a model is loaded, then checked again before save to ensure `valid?` works.
- `QueryProxy` was not converting Boolean properties correctly
- Certain actions that were intended as once-in-the-app's-lifetime events, notably schema operations, will only occur immediately upon the first session's establishment.
- Context now set for Model.all QueryProxy so that logs can reflect that it wasn't just a raw Cypher query

### Removed

- Railtie was removing username/password and putting them into the session options.  This has been unneccessary in `neo4j-core` for a while now

## [6.0.0.alpha.12] - 11-5-2015

### Changed
- `_classname` property has been completely removed, officially dropping support for Neo4j < 2.1.5.
- `ActiveRel#creates_unique` and the `:unique` Association option take arguments to control how the query is built. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/1038.

- Allow calling of `#method=` methods via model `new` method `Hash` argument

### Added
- Alternate `ActiveRel` init syntax: `RelClass.new(from_node, to_node, args)`. This is optional, so giving a single hash with props with or without nodes is still possible.

## [6.0.0.alpha.10] - 11-2-2015

### Fixed
- Long properties in `ActiveNode`/`ActiveRel` `#inspect` are truncated
- Property defaults are set initially when an instance of a model is loaded, then checked again before save to ensure `valid?` works.

### Added
- `ActiveRel` `create` actions can now handle unpersisted nodes.

## [5.2.15] - 11-27-2015

### Fixed

- `#with_associations` should use multiple `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses instead of one so that matches are independent (behavior changed in Neo4j 2.3.0)

## [5.2.13] - 10-26-2015

### Fixed
- Fixed `#after_initialize` and `#after_find` callbacks.
- The `#touch` method should to raise errors when unsuccessful and avoid `#attributes` for performance.

## [5.2.12] - 10-25-2015

### Fixed
- Fix the `#touch` method for `ActiveNode` and `ActiveRel`

## [5.2.11] - 10-18-2015

### Fixed
- Unable to give additional options as first argument to chained QueryProxy method

## [5.2.10] - 10-14-2015

### Fixed
- `has_one` does not define `_id` methods if they are already defined.  Also use `method_defined?` instead of `respond_to?` since it is at the class level

## [5.2.9] - 09-30-2015

### Fixed
- Better error message for `ActiveRel` creation when from_node|to_node is not persisted

## [5.2.8] - 09-30-2015

### Fixed
- Support `references` in model/scaffold generators

## [5.2.7] - 09-25-2015

### Fixed
- Allow for association `model_class` to be prepended with double colons

## [5.2.6] - 09-16-2015

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where caching an association causes further queries on the association to return the cached result

## [5.2.5] - 09-11-2015

### Fixed

- Regression in last release caused properties to revert to default on update if not present in the properties for update

## [5.2.4] - 09-11-2015

### Fixed
- Use `debug` log level for query logging
- `updated_at` properties were not being added up `update` events, only updated.
- Default values of Boolean properties were not being set when `default: false`
- `props_for_update` was using String keys instead of Symbols, like `props_for_update`
- `props_for_create` and `props_for_update` were not adding default property values to the hash.
- ActiveNode's `merge` and `find_or_create` methods were not setting default values of declared properties when `ON CREATE` was triggered. The code now uses `props_for_create`.

## [5.2.3] - 09-07-2015

Added bugfixes from 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 that were missed in earlier 5.2.x releases:
- `AssociationProxy` now responds to `serializable_hash` so that `include` can be used in `render json` in Rails controllers
- Fixed errors when trying to call `#{association}_ids=` on an unpersisted node with UUIDs or an array thereof.
- Removed extra Cypher query to replace relationships when working with unpersisted nodes and association=.
- Bug related to Rails reloading an app and returning nodes without first reinitializing models, resulting in CypherNodes.

## [5.2.2] - 09-06-2015

### Fixed
- Fixed setting of association(_id|_ids) on .create

## [5.2.1] - 09-04-2015

### Fixed
- Now possible to configure `record_timestamps` with rails `config`

## [5.2.0] - 08-30-2015

### Added
- `props_for_persistence`, `props_for_create`, `props_for_update` instance methods for all nodes and rels. Each returns a hash with properties appropriate for sending to the database in a Cypher query to create or update an object.
- Added `record_timestamps` configuration do default all `ActiveNode` and `ActiveRel` models to have `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps (from #939, thanks @rebecca-eakins)
- Added `timestamp_type` configuration to specify how timestamps should be stored (from #939, thanks @rebecca-eakins)

### Changed
- Methods related to basic node and rel persistence (`save`, `create_model`, `_create_node`, others) were refactored to make the processes simpler, clearer, and slightly faster.
- Unit test directory structure was rearranged to mirror the `lib` directory.

## [5.1.3] - 08-23-2015

### Fixed
- `has_one` associations are now properly cached (like `has_many` associations)
- `QueryProxy` now responds to `#to_ary`.  Fixes integration with ActiveModelSerializer gem


## [5.1.2] - 08-20-2015

### Fixed
- When association has `model_class` and `type: false` the association doesn't work (see: https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/930)

## [5.1.1] - 08-19-2015

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the `Neo4j::Timestamps` mixin was not able to be included

## [5.1.0.rc.3] - 08-17-2015

### Fixed
- Associations defined in ActiveNode models will delegate `unique?` to the model set in `rel_class`. This makes it easier for the rel class to act as the single source of truth for relationship behavior.

### Added
- ActiveRel: `#{related_node}_neo_id` instance methods to match CypherRelationship. Works with start/from and end/to.
- ActiveRel: `type` now has a new alias, `rel_type`. You might recognize this from the `(Cypher|Embedded)Relationship` class and ActiveNode association option.
- Contributing to the gem? Rejoice, for it now supports [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

## [5.1.0.rc.2] - 08-16-2015

### Added
- Ability to use `#where_not` method on `ActiveNode` / `QueryProxy`

## [5.1.0.rc.1] - 08-14-2015

### Fixed
- Added a `before_remove_const` method to clear cached models when Rails `reload!` is called. 5.0.1 included a workaround but this appears to cut to the core of the issue. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/855.
- To prevent errors, changing an index to constraint or constraint to index will drop the existing index/constraint before adding the new.
- Fixed `AssociationProxy#method_missing` so it properly raises errors.

### Added
- Added ability to view `model_class` from `Association` class for `rails_admin` Neo4j adapter
- QueryProxy `where` will now look for declared properties matching hash keys. When found, it will send the value through that property's type converter if the type matches the property's unconverted state.
- Improved handling of unpersisted nodes with associations. You can now use `<<` to create associations between unpersisted nodes. A `save` will cascade through unpersisted objects, creating nodes and rels along the way. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/871
- Support formatted cypher queries for easy reading by humans via the `pretty_logged_cypher_queries` configuration variable
- Ability to query for just IDs on associations
- On `QueryProxy` objects you can now use an `:id` key in `where` and `find_by` methods to refer to the property from `id_property` (`uuid` by default)
- Added `ActiveRel.creates_unique` and deprecated `ActiveRel.creates_unique_rel`
- Added #inspect method to ActiveRel to show Cypher-style representation of from node, to node, and relationship type
- Added `Neo4j::Timestamps`, `Neo4j::Timestamps::Created`, and `Neo4j::Timestamps::Updated` mixins to add timestamp properties to `ActiveNode` or `ActiveRel` classes

### Changed

- Methods related to ActiveNode's IdProperty module were refactored to improve performance and simplify the API. Existing `default_properties` methods were reworked to reflect their use as-implemented: storage for a single default property, not multiple.
- Implementation adjustments that improve node and rel initialization speed, particularly when loading large numbers of objects from the database.

## [5.0.15] - 08-12-2015

### Fixed

- `reload!` within Rails apps will work correctly. An earlier release included a workaround but this uses ActiveModel's system for clearing caches to provide a more thorough resolution.

## [5.0.14] - 08-09-2015

### Fixed

- Calling `all` on a QueryProxy chain would cause the currently set node identity within Cypher to be lost.

## [5.0.13] - 08-07-2015

### Fixed
- Backport AssociationProxy#method_missing fix to raise errors on invalid methods
- Fix the count issue on depth two associations (#881)

## [5.0.12] - ?

### Fixed
- Break between associations so that potential `where` clauses get applied to the correct `(OPTIONAL )MATCH` clause

### Fixed
- Delegate `first` and `last` from `AssociationProxy` to `QueryProxy`
- Fix `order` behavior for `first` and `last` in `QueryProxy`

## [5.0.11] - ?

### Fixed
- Delegate `first` and `last` from `AssociationProxy` to `QueryProxy`
- Fix `order` behavior for `first` and `last` in `QueryProxy`

## [5.0.10] - 2015-07-31

### Fixed
- Fix what should have been a very obvious bug in `_active_record_destroyed_behavior` behavior
- Add eager loading to QueryProxy so that it works in all expected places

## [5.0.9] - 2015-07-29

### Fixed
- "NameError: uninitialized constant Class::Date" (https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues/852)

## [5.0.8] - 2015-07-26

### Changed
- Copied QueryClauseMethods doc from master

## [5.0.7] - 2015-07-26

### Changed
- Copied `docs` folder from master because a lot of work had gone into the docs since 5.0.0 was released

## [5.0.6] - 2015-07-22

### Fixed
- Fix query logging so that by default it only outputs to the user in the console and development server.  Logger can be changed with `neo4j.config.logger` configuration option

## [5.0.5] - 2015-07-19

### Added
- Added `log_cypher_queries` configuration option so that queries aren't on by default but that they can be controlled

## [5.0.4] - 2015-07-17

### Fixed
- Fixed bug which caused `QueryProxy` context to repeat (showed up in query logging)

## [5.0.3] - 2015-07-14

### Changed
- Moved `#with_associations` method from `AssociationProxy` to `QueryProxy` so that all `QueryProxy` chains can benefit from it.
- Added `_active_record_destroyed_behavior` semi-hidden configuration variable so that behavior for `ActiveNode#destroyed?` and `ActiveRel#destroyed?` can be changed to upcoming 6.0.0 behavior (matching ActiveRecord) where the database is not accessed.

## [5.0.2] - 2015-06-30

### Fixed
- Fix error when calling `#empty?` or `#blank?` on a query chain with on `order` specified
- Make `#find_each` and `#find_in_batches` return the actual objects rather than the result objects
- Query logging on console should be to STDOUT with `puts`.  Using `Rails.logger` outputs to the file in the `log` directory
- Modified queryproxy include? to accept a uuid instead of full node

## [5.0.1] - 2015-06-23

### Fixed
- Longstanding bug that would prevent association changes (`<<` and ActiveRel.create) in Rails after `reload!` had been called, see https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/839
- ActiveNode#inspect wasn't displaying the id_property
- Default property values and magic typecasting not being inherited correctly

### Changed
- In the absense of a `model_class` key, associations defined in ActiveNode models will use `from_/to_class` defined in `rel_class` to find destination. (Huge thanks to @olance, #838)
- ActiveRel's DSL was made a bit friendlier by making the `type`, `from_class` and `to_class` methods return their set values when called without arguments.
- Reworked ActiveRel's wrapper to behave more like ActiveNode's, removing some duplicate methods and moving others to Neo4j::Shared, resulting in a big performance boost when returning large numbers of rels.
- Updated gemspec to require neo4j-core 5.0.1+

### Added
- ActiveRel was given `find_or_create_by`, usable across single associations.

## [5.0.0] - 2015-06-18

### Fixed
- Prevented `to_key` from requiring an extra DB query. (See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/827)

### Added
- QueryProxy associations accept `labels: false` option to prevent generated Cypher from using labels.

### Changed
- Properties explicitly set to type `Time` will no longer be converted to `DateTime`.

## [5.0.0.rc.3] - 2015-06-07

### Fixed
- Associations now allow `unique` option.  Error handling is generalized to make this testable (Thanks to @olance, see #824)

## [5.0.0.rc.2] - 2015-05-20

### Changed
- Set Ruby version requirement back to 1.9.3 because of problems with JRuby

## [5.0.0.rc.1] - 2015-05-20

### Changed
- Ruby 2.0.0 now required (>= 2.2.1 is recommended)
- All `ActiveNode` associations now require either a `type`, `origin`, or `rel_class` option.  Only one is allowed
- Defining associations will fail if unknown options are used (#796)
- `Model#find` fails if no node found (`Model#find_by` available when `nil` result desired) (#799)
- `#find_or_create` and `#merge` model class methods have been added
- Ensuring that all model callbacks are happening within transactions
- Major refactoring using `rubocop` with a lot of focus on speed improvements
- Specifically when loading many nodes at once we've measured 3x speed improvements

### Fixed
- `#find` on `QueryProxy` objects now does a model `find` rather than an `Enumerable` find
- Subclassed model classes now both create and query against it's ancestor's labels in addition to it's own (#690)
- `#first` and `#last` now work property when precedend by an `#order` in a `QueryProxy` chain (#720)
- `#count` when called after `#limit` will be performed within the bounds of limit specified

### Added
- Eager Loading is now supported!  See: [http://neo4jrb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ActiveNode.html#eager-loading]
- Associations now return `AssociationProxy` objects (which are `Enumerable`) which have convenient `#inspect` methods for cleaner viewing in the Ruby console
- `model_class` key on associations now supports an Array (#589)
- When using `all` inside of a class method an argument for the node name can now be passed in (#737)
- Query(Proxy) syntax of `where("foo = ?", val)` and `where("foo = {bar}", bar: val)` now supported (#675)
- `module_handling` config option now available to control how class module namespaces translate to Neo4j labels (#753) (See: [http://neo4jrb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Configuration.html])
- `#id_property` method has new `constraints` option to disable automatic uuid constraint (#738/#736)

(There are probably other changes too!)

**Changes above this point should conform to [http://keepachangelog.com/]**

## [4.1.2]
- Fixes two bugs related to inheritance: one regarding ActiveRel classes and relationship types, the other regarding ActiveNode primary_key properties not being set when a model is loaded prior to Neo4j session.

## [4.1.1]
- Switches use of Fixnum to Integer to improve 32-bit support

## [4.1.0]
This release includes many performance fixes and new features. The most notable:
- Huge stylist cleanup/refactoring by Brian on the entire gem by Brian armed with Rubocop. See http://neo4jrb.io/blog/2014/12/29/stay-out-of-trouble.html.
- Every node create, update, and destroy is now wrapped in a transaction. See http://neo4jrb.io/blog/2015/01/06/transactions_everywhere.html.
- New `dependent` options for associations: `:delete`, `:destroy`, `:delete_orphans`, `:destroy_orphans`. See http://neo4jrb.io/blog/2015/01/07/association_dependent_options.html.
- New `unique: true` option for associations, `creates_unique_rel` class method for ActiveRel. Both of these will result in relationship creation Cypher using "CREATE UNIQUE" instead of "CREATE".
- Fixed an n+1 query issue during node creation and update.
- Dieter simplified some code related to frozen attributes. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/pull/655.
We now have a new website online at http://neo4jrb.io! Keep an eye on it for news and blogs related to this and other projects.

## [4.0.0]
- Change neo4j-core dependency from 3.1.0 to 4.0.0.

## [4.0.0.rc.4]
- _classname property is disabled by default for ActiveRel! It had been disabled for ActiveNode, this just evens the score.
- Fixes a bug to create better `result` labels in Cypher.
- Made the `delete_all` and `destroy_all` ActiveNode class methods consistent with their ActiveRecord counterparts. `destroy_all` previously performed its deletes in Cypher but it should have been returning nodes to Ruby and calling `destroy`. `delete_all` didn't exist at all.

## [4.0.0.rc.3]
Released minutes after rc.2 to catch one late addition!
- Adds serialization support for QueryProxy.

## [4.0.0.rc.2]
This release builds on features introduced in the first RC. We are releasing this as another RC because the API may be tweaked before release.
- New `proxy_as` for Core::Query to build QueryProxy chains onto Core::Query objects!
- Using `proxy_as`, new `optional` method in QueryProxy to use the `OPTIONAL MATCH` Cypher function.
- `match_to` and methods that depend on it now support arrays of nodes or IDs.
- New `rels_to`/`all_rels_to` methods.
- New `delete` and `destroy` methods in QueryProxy to easily remove relationships.
- Serialized objects will include IDs by default.

## [4.0.0.rc.1]
This release introduces API changes that may be considered breaking under certain conditions. See See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j.rb-v4-Introduction.
Please use https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues for support regarding this update! You can also reach us on Twitter: @neo4jrb (Brian) and @subvertallmedia (Chris).
- Default behavior changed: relationship types default to all caps, no prepending of "#". This behavior can be changed.
- ActiveRel models no longer require explicit calling of `type`. When missing, the model will infer a type using the class name following the same rules used to determine automatic relationship types from ActiveNode models.
- _classname properties will not be added automatically if you are using a version Neo4j >= 2.1.5. Instead, models are found using labels or relationship type. This is a potentially breaking change, particularly where ActiveRel is concerned. See the link at the beginning of this message for the steps required to work around this.
- Query scopes are now chainable! Call `all` at the start of your scope or method to take advantage of this.
- Changes required for Neo4j 2.2.
- Support for custom typecasters.
- New method `rel_where`, expanded behavior of `match_to` and `first_rel_to`
- Implemented ActiveSupport load hooks.
- Assorted performance improvements and refactoring.

## [3.0.4]
- Gemspec requires the latest neo4j-core.
- Fixed a pagination bug — thanks, @chrisgogreen!
- New QueryProxy methods `match_to` and `first_rel_to` are pretty cool.
- include_root_in_json is now configurable through config.neo4j.include_root_in_json or Neo4j::Config[:include_root_in_json]. Also cool.
- There's a new `delete_all` method for QueryProxy, too.
- @codebeige removed the `include?` class method, which was smart.
- Did I mention we won an award from Neo Tech? Check it out. https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j#welcome-to-neo4jrb

## [3.0.3]
- Gemspec has been updated to require neo4j-core 3.0.5
- Added `find_in_batches`
- Pagination has been updated to allow better ordering. Relaunch of neo4j-will_paginate as neo4j-will_paginate_redux is imminent!
- Everything is better: `create`'s handling of blocks, better behavior from `count`, better ActiveRel from_class/to_class checks, better handling of rel_class strings, and more
- Added a new find_or_create_by class method
