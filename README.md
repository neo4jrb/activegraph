# Introduction

Neo4j.rb is an Active Model compliant Ruby/JRuby wrapper for [the Neo4j graph database](http://www.neo4j.org/). It uses the [neo4j-ruby-driver](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-ruby-driver) and [active_attr](https://github.com/cgriego/active_attr) gems.

Neo4j is a transactional, open-source graph database.  A graph database manages data in a connected data structure, capable of  representing any kind of data in a very accessible way.  Information is stored in nodes and relationships connecting them, both of which can have arbitrary properties.  To learn more visit [What is a Graph Database?](http://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/)

With this gem you not only do you get a convenient higher level wrapper around Neo4j, but you have access to a powerful high-level query building interface which lets you take advantage of the power of Neo4j like this:

```ruby
# Break down the top countries where friends' favorite beers come from
person.friends.favorite_beers.country_of_origin(:country).
  order('count(country) DESC').
  pluck(:country, count: 'count(country)')
```

It can be installed in your `Gemfile` with a simple `gem 'neo4j'`

Neo4j.rb v4.1.0 was released in January of 2015. Its changes are outlined [here](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j.rb-v4-Introduction) and in the [announcement message](http://neo4jrb.io/blog/2015/01/09/neo4j-rb_v4-1_released.html). It will take a little time before all documentation is updated to reflect the new release but unless otherwise noted, all 3.X documentation is totally valid for v4.
