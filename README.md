Neo4j.rb v4.1.0 was released in January of 2015. Its changes are outlined [here](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j.rb-v4-Introduction) and in the [announcement message](http://neo4jrb.io/blog/2015/01/09/neo4j-rb_v4-1_released.html). It will take a little time before all documentation is updated to reflect the new release but unless otherwise noted, all 3.X documentation is totally valid for v4.
